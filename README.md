Hello! Iâ€™m `Leo`, and Iâ€™m a Backend Developer and Travel Enthusiast.

- ðŸ’¬ &nbsp;Ask me about anything related to AWS/Java/Python or FastAPI 
- ðŸ”­ &nbsp;Iâ€™m currently working on something cool :wink:
- âš¡ When Iâ€™m not on a computer, Iâ€™m probably making drip coffee or riding my motorbike
